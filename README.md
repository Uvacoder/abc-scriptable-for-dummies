## How to add a new docs Page

Basically you just need the folder **docs** and **sidebars.js**

First you create a markdown file in the **docs** folder (`example.md`) and add the code below at the top of the newly created markdown file.
```
---
id: ID (needed for sidebar.js)
title: TITLE (Title that will be visible when clicking on the page)
sidebar_label: SIDEBAR_TITLE (Title that will be visible on the sidebar of the docs page)
---
```
In the `sidebar.js` you'll just have to add the ID that you've added in the markdown file into the guides array.
```
"⚙️ Guides": ['add-text-widget', 'add-image-widget', <ID>],
```

Now you can start adding stuff in your markdown file =D 

**Note** When adding images, you have to put it in the static folder with a subfolder named after your markdown file.
